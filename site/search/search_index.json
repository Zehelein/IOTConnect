It monitors the data from all configured monitors and publish the gathered data to all configured publishers. This repo is an evolution and an extensible version of Pioniq . Features Connectivity: Connect anything that can be monitored using python with your IOT hub using built in MQTTPublisher. Customization: More systems and information can be monitored and published developing additional Monitors and Publishers. Open-source: You are welcome to improve the service by fixing bugs, adding functionality or developing your own Monitors and Publishers and make a pull request. Documentation I'm working in the documentation, please be patient! It will be there ASAP!!! Informal disclaimer I'm a noob in python programming and I'm not a Linux expert so I'm pretty sure that the source code may be far from efficient, so don't be too hard with me if you find that I'm not following best practices neither doing things in the most optimal way. If you find that anything that can be improved (I'm sure it is), just raise a PR with your improvements or contact me. Disclaimer IOTConnect (\u201cTHE SOFTWARE\u201d) IS PROVIDED AS IS.
