More systems and informations can be monitoried and published developing additional Monitors and Publishers.

## Open-source
You are welcome to improve the service by fixing bugs, adding functionality or developing your own Monitors and Publishers and make a pull request.

# Documentation
I'm working in the documentation, please be patient! It will be there ASAP!!!

# Informal disclaimer
I'm a noob in python programming and I'm not a Linux expert so I'm pretty sure that the source code may be far from efficient, so don't be too hard with me if you find that I'm not following best practices neither doing things in the most optimal way. If you find that anything that can be improved (I'm sure it is), just raise a PR with your improvements or contact me.
